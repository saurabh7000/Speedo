# Speedo

This project involves developing a user-friendly web application where users can create an account and upload Excel or CSV files containing trip coordinates. Once the data is uploaded, users can visualize their trip paths on an interactive map. The application will calculate key metrics such as total distance, total duration, overspeeding duration, and distance during stops for each trip.

Key Features:

- User Account Creation: Secure login and user management.
- File Upload: Support for Excel and CSV formats to import trip data.
- Map Visualization: Display individual and multiple trip paths on an interactive map.
- Data Analysis: Calculate and display total distance, total duration, overspeeding duration, and stopped duration for each trip.
- Multi-Trip Selection: Allow users to select and visualize multiple trips simultaneously.
- Trip Detail Toggle: Easily toggle between trip details to view selected trips on the map, enhancing user interaction and analysis.

This application aims to help users gain insights into their travel patterns, improve route efficiency, and monitor driving behavior effectively.
